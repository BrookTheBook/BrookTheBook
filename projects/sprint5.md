## Inspiration

This web application was created for the Major League Hacking Build Week. It was created during a workshop, but I added my little spin on it.

## What it does

You input a task that needs to get done and press enter. After, you can click on the task to mark it out/ check it off or click the trashbin off to the side to delete it. You can add as many tasks as you want and the number of items on the list are counted at the bottom.

## How we built it

The general code was forked from a project for a workshop but I added on to it and made it my own. I changed the background, added the code to make it cross out and changed the icon on the side to a trashbin. I also formatted the whole thing and added the font. It was created using React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS

## Challenge we ran into

I found it difficult finding out how to get into the code and replace the icon on the side. Through extensive research, I was able to find where the code was that made it and change it to suit my needs.
