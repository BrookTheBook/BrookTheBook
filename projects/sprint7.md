## Inspiration

This project was created to help me learn more of how to use APIs and how Chat apps are made. It gives me more insight on how much work goes behind chat programs.

## What it does

This web application asks for a user and then asks for a message. It then shows up on the chat box.

## How we built it

The program uses the firebase API to make the chat function. Javascript is used to create each element and implement the chat process.

## Challenge we ran into

The main challenge was figuring out to code it in general. It was a new experience creating a chat app and I'm thankful for what I've learnt while making it.
