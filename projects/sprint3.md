## Inspiration

I was inspired by the time of year! We were about to have a Christmas party, so I created a music playlist to play during the party.

## What it does

It plays Christmas Music. You can play and pause the music. It automatically goes to the next song, but you can go through the songs, too.

## How we built it

I created the background using HTML and CSS. The actual playlist part was mainly JavaScript.

## Challenge we ran into

The main challenge was doing the background. I found a tutorial over how to do it correctly.
