## Inspiration

My inspiration for creating the Data Visualization of COVID-19 Cases was the outbreak that recently came out at that time. This project was created in 2020 with the idea to display the amount of COVID-19 cases breaking out in certain areas.

## What it does

As mentioned earlier. this site creates a graph t o display the amount of COVID-19 cases breaking out in certain countries.

## How we built it

This program was created with the use of the Google Visualization API and Javascript. Our code called on the Google Charts API and inputed a data table of COVID-19 cases at that time. A variable was then created to create a title for the graph. Another variable was created to call on the Google Visualization API to create a pie chart. The chart object is then created to render the pie chart using the provided data and title.

## Challenge we ran into

A challenge we ran into was making the chart appear as soon as the site loaded. We had to go into the HTML and use the Gstatic website to load the Google Visualization API quicker.
