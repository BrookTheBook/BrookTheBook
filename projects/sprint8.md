## Inspiration

The main inspiration I had while creating this was to learn how to use APIs and utilize them to create programs.

## How we built it

This program calls on the NY Times API and calls on the image, link and descriptions of the 35+ most recent and displays them in a certain format.

## Challenge we ran into
