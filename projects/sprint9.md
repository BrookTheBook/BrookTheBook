## Inspiration

This project was used to help practice javascript and help me to learn the mechanics mainly. It was created years ago.

## What it does

It works the same as a basic calculator.

## How it was built

I utilized what I learnt in my Enlight cohort to create a calculator using basic javascript mechanics.

## Challenge we ran into

It wasn't that much of a challenge since I pick things up easily.
