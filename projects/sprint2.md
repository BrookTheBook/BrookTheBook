## Inspiration

I was inspired by the idea that sometimes we need a break from hacking to play games and have fun. I did this for Local Hack Day: Build 2021 Day 4

## What it does

It's a simple tic tac toe game. It has the same controls as tic tac toe.

## How we built it

I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to do the JavaScript from a tutorial. I designed it using the CSS.

## Accomplishments we're proud of

I'm proud that I created a fully function website that included JavaScript. I'm not that good at JavaScript. I suprised myself my accomplishing this challenge.

## What I learned

I learned how to better incorporate JavaScript in to websites.
